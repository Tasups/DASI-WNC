          Request DASI at least 2 weeks in advance at the theater you wish to attend to allow the theater to make proper arrangements with DASI. The day of the performance, arrive 20-30 minutes prior to curtain time to pick up your receiver. Pre Show description usually begins 25 to 20 minutes prior to curtain time. Once the performance is over, return your receiver and earpiece to the DASI representative and then make sure to spread the word about DASI!

      <h2 className="get-involved-headers">Volunteers</h2>
        <h3>
          There are several opportunities to get involved with DASI. Volunteers are needed to describe performances, read information before the show, and at intermission and to manage equipment for a performance. We like to have at least 3 volunteers for each described show. In addition, behind the scenes volunteers help distribute brochures, coordinate with theaters, drive listeners to the theater, and are members of the board. Our Board consists of visually impaired and sighted members of the community. If you are interested in volunteering for DASI, please contact the DASI President.

        <h3>
          If you represent a theater or venue and would like DASI to describe an event, please contact the DASI President. Typically our describers need at least two week's notice to describe a show in order to prepare a quality description script. You will be asked to provide our describers access to scripts to be able to attend dress rehearsals so they can learn costumes, scenery, etc to effectively describe a performance. If you are not a theater, (e.g. museum, church) DASI services are available for you as well. There is a fee charged to the venue to have DASI provide AD for your event. Please contact the DASI President for details.

Contributions help pay for equipment upkeep, promotional materials, and for training our describers. Checks, made payable to DASI, can be mailed to the DASI President.
